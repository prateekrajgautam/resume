abstract={This paper presents an Enhanced Cost and Sub-Epoch based Stable Energy-Efficient Clustering (ECSSEEC) for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks. In ECSSEEC protocol, modeled cost function selects optimum number of cluster heads (CHs) and sub-epoch rotates previously selected CHs again as normal sensing nodes for future rounds as selected in CSSEEC. It also provides generalized radio model expression for different fading channels of HWSNs. Simulation results show that ECSSEEC achieves effective performance in network for stability period, usable period, and weak sensing period than previously existing hierarchical protocols (i.e., SEARCH, DEEC, SEP and LEACH) in Rayleigh fading environment for two level HWSNs.},
